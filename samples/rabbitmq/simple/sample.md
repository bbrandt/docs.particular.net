## Code walk-through

This sample shows a basic usage of RabbitMQ as a transport for NServiceBus.

### Enable RabbitMQ

<!-- import ConfigureRabbit -->

### Configuring RabbitMQ

Since the above connection string does not define a username NServicebus will default to 

```
username: guest
password: guest
```

For more information on the RabbitMQ connection string see [Configuring RabbitMQ transport to be used](/nservicebus/rabbitmq/configuration-api.md)
