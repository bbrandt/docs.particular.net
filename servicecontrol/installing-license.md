## Using the registry
When the license is [installed in the registry](/nservicebus/licensing/license-management.md) it is available machine wide and applied to all Particular products running on that machine.


## Using the license file

Create a folder called `License` under the folder where ServiceControl is installed and copy `license.xml` file there.  E.g.   `{servicecontrol-directory}/license/license.xml`
