## Avaliable transports

### [MSMQ](/nservicebus/msmq)

MSMQ is the default transport used by NServiceBus.

### [SqlServer](/nservicebus/sqlserver)

Uses Sql Server tables as a queuing mechanism

### [Azure](/nservicebus/azure)

Uses either Azure Servicebus or Azure Storage Queues as a transport/

### Community run transports

There are several community run transports that can be seen on the full list of [Extensions](/platform/extensions.md#transports).

### WebSphereMQ
