NServiceBus endpoints support sending and receiving large chunks of data via the [DataBus feature](databus.md).

It is possible to create your own DataBus implementation by implementing the `IDataBus` interface, such as in the following minimalistic sample:

<!-- import CustomDataBus -->

To configure the endpoint to use your custom DataBus implementation it is enough to register it at endpoint configuration time, such as in the following sample:

<!-- import PluginCustomDataBusV5 -->
