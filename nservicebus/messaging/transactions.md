This article covers various levels of guarantees NServiceBus provides with regards to coordination of receiving messages, updating user data and sending out other messages. It does not discuss the transaction isolation aspect which only applies to the process of updating the user data and does not affect the overall coordination and failure handling.

## Transactions

Based on transaction handling mode, NServiceBus offers three levels of guarantees with regards to message processing

### Unreliable

In this mode the transport in use does not attempt to wrap the receive operation in any kind of transaction. Once the message has been received, it can't be put back into the queue. Should the message processing fail for any reason (including system crash), the message is **permanently lost**. 

<!-- import TransactionsDisable -->

### Transport transaction

In this mode, if supported by the transport, the receive operation is wrapped in a native transaction. The same transaction is used when processing of the message results in sending out other messages. This mode guarantees that the message is not permanently deleted from the incoming queue until at least one processing attempt (including storing user data and sending out messages) is not finished successfully.

NOTE: In this mode messages on the wire can get duplicated at each endpoint so the handler logic has to be designed to be idempotent.

<!-- import TransactionsDisableDistributedTransactions -->

### Ambient transaction

In this mode, if supported by the transport, the receive transaction is wrapped in `TransactionScope`. All the operations inside this scope, both sending messages and manipulating data, are guaranteed to be executed (eventually) as a whole or rolled back as a whole. There is no atomicity guarantee as changes to the database might be visible *before* the messages on the queue or vice-versa. Specific configurations might provide stronger guarantees, but not weaker.

That **does not** mean that a distributed transaction is started right away. The transaction is only escalated to the distributed one (following two-phase commit protocol) when it is required. An example when it is not required to do so is using SQL Server transport with NHibernate persistence, both in the same database. Since in this case ADO.NET driver guarantees that everything happens inside a single database transaction, ACID guarantees are held for the whole processing.

Ambient transaction mode is enabled by default. It can be enabled explicitly via

<!-- import TransactionsEnable -->

## Handlers

In the ambient transaction mode NServiceBus executes all message handlers in a single `TransactionScope` in order to ensure that all the data manipulations are either executed as a whole or rolled back as a whole. This behaviour can be disabled

<!-- import TransactionsDoNotWrapHandlersExecutionInATransactionScope --> 

resulting in suppressing any ambient transaction if existed. This effectively turns the *ambient transaction* mode into *transport transaction* mode with regards to handler behariour (the only different is type of transation used by the transport). Some (or all) handlers might get invoked multipe times and partial results might be visible: 
 * partial updates (where one handler succeeded updating its data but the other didn't), 
 * partial sends (where some of the messages has been sent but others not),
 * sends without matching updates (where messages has already been sent but the update failed).


NOTE: Starting with version 5, in the *transport transaction* and *unreliable* modes this behavior is the default. Wrapping the handlers in the `TransactionScope` has to be enabled explicitly

<!-- import TransactionsWrapHandlersExecutionInATransactionScope -->

## Outbox

Outbox is a [feature](/nservicebus/outbox) (enabled by default only for RabbitMQ transport, requires explicit enabling when using other transports) that enhances the *transport transaction* mode guarantees. 

<!-- import TransactionsOutbox -->

When using the outbox, the messages resulting from processing a given received message are not being sent immediately but rather and stored in the persistence database and pushed out after handling logic is done. This mechanism ensures that the handling logic can only succeed once so there is no need to design for idempotence.
