When using a framework like NServiceBus you usually need to create your own units of work to avoid having to repeat code in your message handlers. For example, committing NHibernate transactions, or calling `SaveChanges` on the RavenDB session.

### IManageUnitsOfWork 

To create your unit of work, implement the `IManageUnitsOfWork` interface. 

<!-- import UnitOfWorkImplementation -->

The semantics are that `Begin()` is called when the transport messages enters the pipeline. Remember that a transport message can consist of multiple application messages. This allows you to do any setup that is required. 

The `End()` method is called when the processing is complete. If there is an exception, it is passed into the method. 

This gives you a way to perform different actions depending on the outcome of the message(s).

### Registering your unit of work 

After implementing a `IManageUnitsOfWork`, you now need to register it with NServiceBus. 
Here's an example of how to register your unit of work:  

<!-- import InstancePerUnitOfWorkRegistration -->

NOTE: If you prefer, you can do the registration of the Unit of work by implementing the `INeedInitialization` in the same class that implements `IManageUnitsOfWork`.
