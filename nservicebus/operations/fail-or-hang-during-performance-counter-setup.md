## Symptoms

Sometimes an NServiceBus endpoint hangs or fails during startup while initializing the performance counters at the following location `NServiceBus.Unicast.Transport.Monitoring.ReceivedPerformanceDiagnostics.SetupCounter`.

## Cause 

This can happen when the performance counter libraries get corrupted.

## Resolution

The performance counters libraries need to be rebuild by doing the following steps:

1. Open an elevated command prompt
2. Execute the following command to rebuild the performance counter libraries:

    `LODCTR /R`  (Mind the uppercase /R)


{{NOTE: Due to the corruption you may have to re-install performance counters of NServiceBus or other products. The following articles help in restoring the NServiceBus performance counters:

 * [Managing NServiceBus using Powershell](/nservicebus/operations/management-using-powershell.md)

See the Microsoft support links for more information to restore common Windows performance counters.
